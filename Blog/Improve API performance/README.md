## How to Improve API Performance

### 1. Pagination

Pagination is a common optimization technique when result sets are large. By streaming results back to the client in pages, service responsiveness can be improved.

### 2. Asynchronous Logging

Synchronous logging writes to disk on every API call, slowing down the system. With asynchronous logging, logs are first sent to a lock-free buffer and control is immediately returned. The buffer contents are then flushed periodically to disk, significantly reducing I/O overhead.

### 3. Caching

Frequently accessed data can be cached for fast retrieval. Clients can query the cache first instead of hitting the database directly every time. For cache misses, the database can be queried as a fallback. In-memory caches like Redis provide faster data access compared to databases.

### 4. Payload Compression

Request and response payloads can be compressed using algorithms such as gzip to reduce transmitted data volume. This speeds up upload and download times.

### 5. Connection Pooling

Opening and closing database connections has significant overhead. Using a pool of open connections avoids this. The connection pool manages lifecycle events internally.
